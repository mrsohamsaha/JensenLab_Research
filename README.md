# Jensen Lab Research
Projects done for Jensen Lab, a computational genomics lab headed by [Dr. Paul Jensen](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pjens). More information about the lab's current research can be found [here](http://jensenlab.net/).

## Project Summaries

### Opentrons
[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/) is a company that produces pipetting robots. Users can create protocols to sent to the robot through a Python API. My first project was to create protocols for bacteria transformation experiments.

### Colony Picker
Colony Picker is the current project I'm working on. The goal is to create a computer vision program that can analyze a picture of a petri dish full of bacteria colonies and detect the most favorable colonies to pick out.
